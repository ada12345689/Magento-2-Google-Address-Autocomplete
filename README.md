# Magento-2-Google-Address-Autocomplete

Provide your customers with a speedy, easy and convenient checkout process with the Magento 2 Google Address Autocomplete Extension.

A complicated and lengthy checking-out process is one of the biggest factors responsible for high cart abandonment ratios. If store owners want to reduce their website’s cart abandonment ratios, they have to make their customer’s checkout process simpler and less time-consuming.

Adding multiple checkout fields can benefit the business regarding certain points, but if those fields fail to provide customers with a convenient checkout process, it may lead to high cart abandonment rates.

Which checkout field has the highest number of fields? The address field. If a store merchant is looking forward to speeding up the website’s checkout process, then it must have Magento 2 Address Suggestion Extension. This Magento 2 extension will suggest the related address as soon as the customer types a few letters in the address field.
